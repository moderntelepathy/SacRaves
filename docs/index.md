# Collaborating on the Meta-Religion of the Future

Panentheon is a collaborative project dedicated to exploring and presenting an Evolutionary Panentheism as a meta-religion and comprehensive philosophical system. Our aim is to integrate the teachings and insights of various spiritual and philosophical traditions into a comprehensive guide that is rational, enlightening, and deeply human. The project's scope includes defining the lexicon for this meta-tradition, as well as the cultural artifacts, including customs, iconography, etc. by synthesizing and syncretizing from our shared collective religious and cultural heritage.
